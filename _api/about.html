### About
Here at Year4000 we provide a simple public API server to pull info from our systems. This allows for external developers and internal developers to build cool stuff.


### Security
Each request is layed under **SSL** and protected by **CloudFlare**.


### Global Query
Every request has a few query paramerters to change the outcome of the API.

- `?compact` This will make the request compact leading to smaller requests.
- `?callback=METHOD` Using jsonp the request will call a jsonp function. **METHOD** is the name of the method that will be called.
- `?key=KEY` Some requests provided extra data that needs a key to access. **KEY** is a UUID generated key from the [auth route](/api/auth).
